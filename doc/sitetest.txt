This document describes how to remove the code that causes all
of the site tests to be run. Once these steps are performed, you
can safely remove the site_tests list from tests/wamttest.ml.

wamt.ml
-------
1. In fn. process_site

* remove line:
  let site_tests = Wamttest.site_tests in

* remove lines:
  let run_site_tests a b =
    a@[(b site page_reports)]
  in

* remove line:
  (List.fold_left run_site_tests [] site_tests)

wamtml.ml
---------
1. In type def. wamt_site_report

* remove field:
  mutable site_test_results : wamt_test list;

2. In fn. create_wamt_site_report

* remove fn. parameter:
  n_site_test_results

* remove line:
  site_test_results = n_site_test_results;

3. In fn. wamt_site_report_to_xml

* remove lines:
  let tests_string =
    let g a b =
      (a^(wamt_test_to_xml b)) in
      List.fold_left g "" r.site_test_results
  in

* remove substring from Printf.sprintf format string:
  <site>\n%s</site>

* remove last Printf.sprintf argument
  tests_string;;

Note: To preserve this code in case we actually decide to use site
tests again, it may be better to eliminate calls to the site tests
by simply removing all of the elements from the site_tests list in
tests/wamttest.ml.
