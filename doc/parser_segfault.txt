Apparently one factor that causes the parser to crash is processing files
with many, many lines. And for some cases, a remedy is to strip out all
blank lines.

The file at http://www2.lib.msu.edu/general/library-hours-access.jsp,
when downloaded by wget, has approximately 34,196 lines in it and causes
wamt to crash by trying to use too much memory. After stripping out lines
that contain only whitespace characters, the file contains 3,875 lines,
and can then be processed by wamt without any problems.
